 - Physical memory will be a two-dimensional array to simulate the page-frame# and the page of byte-addressable, byte-sized data. 
 - For instance, if physical memory can hold 16 pages of data and each page is 1kB, 
 then you would have a 2d array like: ram[16][1024]. 
 - In each byte of ram you will store an integer value 
 (yes, an int is typically larger than a byte but this will make the project simpler)

- Physical memory address width is 12 bits
