- The OS uses the clock algorithm for page replacement

Note: you are not permitted to use any containers or data structures provided by your chosen language other
than simple arrays (i.e., no arraylists). You must implement the clock replacement algorithmâ€™s data structure
as a circular linked list. This should be done in the OS (kernel).
